# MIMIQ Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network Model

This repository contains the implementation of the MIMIQ deep learning convolutional neural network model. The model is designed for fruit MRI image denoising and image quality enhancement.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Contains the data used for training.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required to run the code.
- `Training_losses.pkl`: Stores the loss values of the trained model.
- `model_weights.pth`: Contains the parameters of the trained model.
- `MIMIQ_CNN_autoencoder.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the MIMIQ CNN model.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone [<repository_url>](https://github.com/ThomAlk/MIMIQ-Deep-Learning-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Model)

2. Install the dependencies 
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `MIMIQ_CNN_autoencoder.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model.
